The Employee acknowledges that, in any position the Employee may hold, in and as a result of the Employee's employment by the Employer, the Employee will, or may, be making use of, acquiring or adding to information which is confidential to the Employer (the \"Confidential Information\") and the Confidential Information is the exclusive property of the Employer.<br><br>\n29.  The Confidential Information will include all data and information relating to the business and management of the Employer, including but not limited to, proprietary and trade secret technology and accounting records to which access is obtained by the Employee, including Work Product, Computer Software, Other Proprietary Data, Business Operations, Marketing and Development Operations, and Customer Information.<br><br>\n30.

The Employee agrees that if there is any question as to such disclosure then the Employee will seek out senior management of the Employer prior to making any disclosure of the Employer's information that may be covered by this Agreement.<br><br>\n34.  The Employee agrees and acknowledges that the Confidential Information is of a proprietary and confidential nature and that any disclosure of the Confidential Information to a third party in breach of this Agreement cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated for in money damages, would cause irreparable injury to Employer, would gravely affect the effective and successful conduct of the Employer's business and goodwill, and would be a material breach of this Agreement<br><br>\n35.  The obligations to ensure and protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information imposed on the Employee in this Agreement and any obligations to provide notice under this Agreement will survive the expiration or termination, as the case may be, of this Agreement and will continue for one (1) year from the date of such expiration or termination, except in the case of any Confidential Information which is a trade secret in which case those obligations will last indefinitely.<br><br>\n36.  The Employee may disclose any of the Confidential Information:\n</p><ul>\n<li>To a third party where Employer has consented in writing to such disclosure; or</li>\n<li>To the extent required by law or by the request or requirement of any judicial, legislative, administrative or other governmental body after providing reasonable prior notice to the Employer.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><br>\n37.  If the Employee loses or makes unauthorised disclosure of any of the Confidential Information, the Employee will immediately notify the Employer and take all reasonable steps necessary to retrieve the lost or improperly disclosed Confidential Information.<br><br><p></p>\n<h5>Ownership and Title to Confidential Information</h5>\n<p>38.  The Employee acknowledges and agrees that all rights, title and interest in any Confidential Information will remain the exclusive property of the Employer. Accordingly, the Employee specifically agrees and acknowledges that the Employee will have no interest in the Confidential Information, including, without limitation, no interest in know-how, copyright, trade-marks or trade names, notwithstanding the fact that the Employee may have created or contributed to the creation of the Confidential Information.<br><br>\n39.  The Employee waives any moral rights that the Employee may have with respect to the Confidential Information.<br><br>\n40.  The Employee agrees to immediately disclose to the Employer all Confidential Information developed in whole or in part by the Employee during the Employee's term of employment with the Employer and to assign to the Employer any right, title or interest the Employee may have in the Confidential Information. The Employee agrees to execute any instruments and to do all other things reasonably requested by the Employer, both during and after the Employee's employment with the Employer, in order to vest more fully in the Employer all ownership rights in those items transferred by the Employee to the Employer.<br><br></p>\n<h5>Return of Confidential Information</h5>\n<p>41.  The Employee agrees that, upon request of the Employer or upon termination or expiration, as the case may be, of this employment, the Employee will turn over to the Employer all Confidential Information belonging to the Employer, including but not limited to, all documents, plans, specifications, disks or other computer media, as well as any duplicates or backups made of that Confidential Information in whatever form or media, in the possession or control of the Employee that:\n</p><ul>\n<li>May contain or be derived from ideas, concepts, creations, or trade secrets and other proprietary and Confidential Information as defined in this Agreement; or</li>\n<li>Is connected with or derived from the Employee's employment with the Employer.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><br><p></p>\n<h5>Contract Binding Authority</h5>\n<p>42.

Notwithstanding any other term or condition expressed or implied in this Agreement, in the event that the Employer will discontinue operating its business at the location where the Employee is employed, then, at the Employer's sole option, and as permitted by law, this Agreement will terminate as of the last day of the month in which the Employer ceases operations at such location with the same force and effect as if such last day of the month were originally set as the Termination Date of this Agreement<br><br></p>\n<h5>Termination of Employment</h5>\n<p>44.  Where there is just cause for termination, the Employer may terminate the Employee's employment without notice, as permitted by law.<br><br>\n45.  The Employee and the Employer agree that reasonable and sufficient notice of termination of employment by the Employer is the greater of two (2) weeks or any minimum notice required by law.<br><br>\n46.  If the Employee wishes to terminate this employment with the Employer, the Employee will provide the Employer with the greater of two (2) weeks and the minimum required by law. As an alternative, if the Employee co-operates with the training and development of a replacement, then sufficient notice is given if it is sufficient notice to allow the Employer to find and train the replacement.<br><br>\n47.\tThe Termination Date specified by either the Employee or the Employer may expire on any day of the month and upon the Termination Date the Employer will forthwith pay to the Employee any outstanding portion of the compensation including any accrued vacation and banked time, if any, calculated to the Termination Date.<br><br>\n48.  Once notice has been given by either party for any reason, the Employee and the Employer agree to execute their duties and obligations under this Agreement diligently and in good faith through to the end of the notice period. The Employer may not make any changes to compensation or any other term or condition of this Agreement between the time termination notice is given through to the end of the notice period.<br><br>\n</p>\n<h5>Remedies</h5>\n<p>49.  In the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Employee of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Employee agrees that the Employer is entitled to a permanent injunction, in addition to and not in limitation of any other rights and remedies available to the Employer at law or in equity, in order to prevent or restrain any such breach by the Employee or by the Employee's partners, agents, representatives, servants, employees, and/or any and all persons directly or indirectly acting for or with the Employee.<br><br>\n</p>\n<h5>Severability</h5>\n<p>50.  The Employer and the Employee acknowledge that this Agreement is reasonable, valid and enforceable. However, if any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, it is the parties' intent that such provision be changed in scope by the court only to the extent deemed necessary by that court to render the provision reasonable and enforceable and the remainder of the provisions of this Agreement will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated as a result.<br><br></p>\n<h5>Notices</h5>\n<p>51.  Any notices, deliveries, requests, demands or other communications required here will be deemed to be completed when hand-delivered, delivered by agent, or seven (7) days after being placed in the post, postage prepaid, to the parties at the following addresses or as the parties may later designate in writing:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Employer:<br>\nName:\tDisability Support Victoria Pty Ltd<br>\nAddress:\tUnit 30, 22-30 Wallace Avenue, Point Cook, VIC 3030<br>Email:\tinfovictoria@vertex360.com.au<br><br></li>\n<li>Employee:</li></ul><p></p>\n\n\n"
